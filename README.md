# BookingService

BookingService is a .NET 9 Web API that acts as a **booking ledger** for users registering to events.  
It provides booking creation, deletion, and querying functionality, while keeping track of active participants per event.

---

## Features

- Manage **bookings**:
  - Create bookings for users against events
  - Delete individual bookings, or delete all bookings for a given user or event
  - Automatically timestamp bookings with `CreatedAt`

- Track **active participants**:
  - Count how many users are registered for an event
  - Enforce consistency by deriving participants count from bookings

- REST API with Swagger documentation
- Data validation using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`
- Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- Layered architecture:
  - **Persistence** (Entities, DbContext, Repositories)
  - **Application** (DTOs, Models, Services)
  - **Presentation** (Controllers / API endpoints)
